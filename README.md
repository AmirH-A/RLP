## Overview

This repository contains a Circom circuit designed for generating and verifying Ethereum account RLP (Recursive Length Prefix) encodings. It leverages the power of zk-SNARKs for efficient and secure verifications on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **RLP Encoding:** Handles the encoding of Ethereum account data using RLP.
- **zk-SNARKs:** Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of the encoding.
- **Optimized Circuits:** Designed with efficiency in mind to minimize gas costs and computation time.

## Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/)
- [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)
